# Chess App

This is a README file for the Chess App project. The Chess App is an Android application that allows two human players to play a game of chess on their phones. The app is based on the terminal-based Chess program and extends its functionality to provide additional features. The main features of the Chess App include playing chess, recording games, and game playback.

## Playing Chess
- Two human players can use the app to play a game of chess.
- The app draws the chessboard with icons representing the pieces and correctly shaded squares.
- Players can move their pieces using touch input, either by dragging a piece or by touching the original square and then the destination square.
- The app provides an 'undo' function that allows players to undo the last move.
- An 'AI' button is available that chooses a move for the current player. The AI selects a move randomly from the set of legal moves.
- The app includes functional 'draw' and 'resign' buttons for the players to use during the game.
- When the game is over, the app reports the outcome.

## Recording Games
- The app records all games as they are being played.
- At the end of a game, the app offers to store the recorded game and prompts the user for a game title.
- The recorded games are stored and can be accessed later.

## Game Playback
- The app provides a function that allows the user to play a selected recorded game.
- The selected game can be played one move at a time, per player.
- The user can click to see the next move, and the moves are not auto-animated.
